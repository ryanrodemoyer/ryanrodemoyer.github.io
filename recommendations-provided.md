These are some of the LinkedIn recommendations I've provided for past colleagues. All recommendations are based on my personal experience working with the individual. I've collected these recommendations here for easy reference and to showcase my ability to provide thoughtful and meaningful recommendations.

# P.G. - VP of Software Engineering

P.G. is a remarkable leader - he empowers his teams and organization to solve problems while working to provide the resources and people needed to create terrific solutions. He has a unique/rare ability to be technically focused while also staying detached from the day to day minutia to keep our team focused on the big picture.

P.G. was amongst of handful of people in the organization that could actually move the needle. He was truly instrumental in the rewrite/reimagination of our flagship product and he solved problems that, quite frankly, didn't come with a default playbook. P.G. set a direction and vision, instilled that in his leadership group and people, and trusted us to execute.

"It's what you practice, not what you preach" goes the saying and P.G. practiced and valued collaboration. He knows the value of cross-functional communication to get our people talking with one another to solve problems and build solutions. He demonstrated his commitment to this value by instilling in our organization an ownership mentality where we were all responsible for driving towards to optimal outcome.

I recall a moment where I helped recruit one of our pivotal team members to Mortgage Cadence. This person was on the fence about joining after having talked only to our general recruiting team. To be completely honest, a large part of my pitch was coming to work for P.G. as I thought he was a great boss to work for and work with - this team member would be challenged in many ways but also presented with tremendous growth opportunities. The person ended up joining and became a very important member of our team.

The mentorship I received from P.G. helped me build confidence and real abilities in my own leadership skillset to keep me going and growing in my own career. I didn't know it at the time that going to work for P.G. would truly change my life.

It's with my highest and strongest recommendation that I endorse P.G. as someone you need on your team.

# N.W. - Product Manager

N.W. is a remarkable team member and someone that I grew to trust over our years of working together. N.W. and I worked together over the course of several years - sometimes closely and sometimes at a distance. Building a relationship with N.W. was important part of my personal growth because he's one of those people that ALWAYS brings his A game and keeps other people around him on their toes because he sets the bar for a leader.

First and foremost - N.W. was perpetually squared away, ready for anything and willing to help at all times. Year over year N.W. took on more responsibilities, covered for other people and did everything within his control to maximize the output for his team and product. He was the embodiment of "no job is too big or too small".

N.W. grew and mentored a software development/scrum team into a high functioning team that consistently delivered value. Numerous team members joined early in their career and grew into high performers that eventually were promoted into other roles or moved to other areas of the organization to pursue more responsibility and/or career growth. N.W. knows how to put people in positions to succeed and then give them to runaway to grow and mature.

N.W. gets my absolute highest recommendation. You will be extremely hard pressed to find someone with his level of experience, expertise and down right grit to deliver all around exceptional performance.

# J.G. - Software Engineering Manager

J.G. is a rock solid manager and does a great job. I've been really impressed with his abilities and performance while working with him. He's an excellent communicator, cares about his team, takes pride in his work, mentors everyone around him, always willing to work together and accept feedback/input from others and he has a great intuition for which issues a manger should pursue and which should wait a little longer.

His technical skills are pretty sharp which is sometimes difficult to find in an engineering manager. As a manager, we are often pulled in multiple directions at any one time so it's refreshing to see someone who can handle these distractions and then just as easily get into a technical issue to see it through to resolution.

J.G. is absolutely and without doubt someone you want on your team.

# M.D - Software Engineering Manager

M.D. is a remarkable software engineer and leader. He embodies the characteristics of both roles and can move between them with the same ease that of which a chameleon changes color. M.D. is the rare software engineering manager that keeps his programming skills as sharp as they were when he was slinging code on a full-time basis.

Two things come to mind when I think about M.D.. First, he's someone I want on my team. The rare software engineer that can make significant contributions at all layers of a project - diving into the legacy code with smile and then in the next breath leading a greenfield project. Second, he raises the bar for what I expected from myself and others on the team. M.D. brought his A-game on a daily basis which kept me motivated to bring mine. It was a healthy competition that made each of us better.

We didn't agree on everything, nor should we. He had his way of doing things and I had mine and we both were able to consistently produce great results. What was unique is that we kept our discussions healthy where we genuinely considered the viewport of the other person to remain open to a better approach when it made a difference.

M.D. is a skilled and confident leader - someone that can be trusted with top-performers to give them runway to perform and excel as well as the team members that are struggling to find their place. M.D. has significant experience and a well tuned barometer for what to expect through the spectrum of employee and team performance.

It's with my highest and strongest recommendation that I endorse M.D. as someone you need on your team.
