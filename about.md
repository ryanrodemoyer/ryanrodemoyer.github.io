My name is Ryan Rodemoyer and I am a software engineer, manager, husband, father and son.

### More Information

By day, I am a software engineering manager focusing on leadership. I am passionate about building high performing teams and helping individuals grow. Jokingly and seriously, I describe my role as "getting teams of people to build software used by teams of people".

By night, I am a family-man and jiu-jitsu white belt. I am passionate about my family and spending time with them. I am also passionate about learning and growing. I am always looking for ways to improve myself and lead my family.
