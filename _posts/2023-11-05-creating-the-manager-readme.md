title: Creating The Manager README
---

I always thought it was kind of cool to stumble on a Manager README file from a “successful manager”. It gave me insight into their thought process and with that I hope to find something that can help me level up my own skills. I had a decision to make when I became an official manager - is a Manager README something I want to create for myself? With hindsight as a friend, the answer is a resounding Heck Yeah! [My Manager README is published here](/manager-readme/). But is authoring a Manager README the correct decision for you?

To put it simply, a Manager README is a document that outlines your management style, expectations, and preferences. It’s a user manual for you as a manager, and it is something that you can choose to share with your team members.

Unsurprisingly, the internet was polarized on the value of a Manager README. I read from those that felt it was contentious and narcissistic. Others felt like it was a useful tool when leveraged in the right way. My thought process was that if nothing else, if I only kept this document private, I should create it to explore my own thoughts to really discover who I wanted to be as a manager. In the end, I was very proud of what I created. I have gone on to share this with others in the management team, my direct reports and the public internet. Sharing this document is one of the better career decisions I have ever made.

First, creating my Manager README allowed me to rapidly build my identity as a manager. From the beginning, I learned who I want to be and how I would try to conduct myself.

Second, it has greased the wheels and got me moved along in job interviews. The hiring team has the best picture of what it’s going to be like to add me to their management team. Interviewers have shared only positive feedback on this document and voiced their appreciation for providing it. In one case, I was rejected for a lead role but then called back a few months later for an additional opening purely because they thought my Manager README distinguished me from other candidates.

Third, I continue to leverage the content I created in my Manager README to help me communicate ideas and create policy for my current teams. I’ve lost track of the times I’ve referred back to this document to help me fast track a current initiative or make a quick decision because I had already put in the thought-cycles to know how to act.

Should you create a Manager README? Or even an Engineer README? I sure think you should, if that’s not already obvious :) You'll never regret putting a few hours into the project. It’s a great document to have even if your decision is to keep it to yourself. Do you have an existing README? My contact information is below, share your README with me.
