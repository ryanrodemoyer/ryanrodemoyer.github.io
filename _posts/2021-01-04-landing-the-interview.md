# Know your worth.

- Know _your_ salary and benefits requirements. YOU are the only person who can decide. DO NOT let anyone else define your worth.
- I believe this to be the best answer when the recruiter asks "What are your salary requirements?":

_I'm targeting positions with a base salary of at least $N per year. I understand there are many factors that go in to making an offer including salary, equity, performance bonuses, health benefits, time off, etc. Those are difficult to quantify as they vary so much from company to company. If an offer materializes, I will consider all aspects of the compenstation package to make my decision._

# Create a respectable LinkedIn page.

- Include respectable profile picture.
- Has relevant career information.
- Connect with people you know.
- Solicit your peers for valid endorsements (if you're comfortable with this step).

# Targeting Open Positions

- Target positions within your a) salary range or slightly above b) experience and skill level or slightly above.
- Many companies are willing to exceed their max salary range for the right candidate.
- Salary ranges aren't always published so it's your choice to skip this job (their loss) or pursue at the risk of wasting time because you already know your worth. If you are willing to risk wasting time, then it's super important to use the initial phone screen as the time to level set on salary expectations.
- Apply to positions you find! DO NOT LIMIT YOURSELF simply because the job description wants 15 years of experience! Hiring managers are looking for candidates to tick several requirements boxes and very few candidates (if any) will tick all the boxes.
- Many companies have multiple positions they are trying to fill that vary only by experience and skill. For example, Company A wants to high four software engineers and they want the hires ratio'd at one senior, two mid-level and one junior. Your goal should be to get in to their pipeline and a solid recruiter will get you to the right door (assuming you're not a brick).

# Connect with the recruiter and/or hiring manager after submitting an application.

- Do your best recon to find THE hiring manager (or a hiring manager if all else fails) for the position.
- Connect with this person on LinkedIn with a message similar to "Hello, my name is <name> and I applied for position XYZ on <platform>. Just putting my face to my name. Looking forward to talking with you about this opportunity."

# The Phone Screen

- Your GOAL is two-fold: 1) get on the phone with another human and impress this person 2) determine if this is a position you want to pursue and company to whom you want to offer your services.
- Take notes.
- Write down the questions they ask. After the interview, re-visit these questions and write down an answer. This will pay dividends for future interviews with any person or company. Writing is the most legitimate and sincere habit to determine your thoughts on a subject or topic.
- Have 2-3 questions prepared. The worst thing to do is end the call with "nope, no questions from me."
  1.  Tell me a little bit about your relationship to the team for where this position will be?
  1.  The job requirement lists a lot of wants and needs for their ideal candidate. Which of these needs and which are wants? What are the non-negotiable skills this person must have?
  1.  Tell me about the culture within this team, group, company, etc. without using the word "collaborative".
  1.  Tell me about the interview process starting with where we are right now and through the final interview process. Do your best to get specific details. Some companies have a thorough and well established process. And some companies seem to make it up as they go.

## Company Research

- As a hiring manager, it is great to see candidates that show some level of preparation.
- Your decision on when to perform company reconnaissance. Recon can be a time consuming activity for positions that may never materialize beyond the first or second interview. If you do recon at the beginning - great. I think it's acceptable to defer recon until you're sure you actually want the job and it seems like a good mutual fit. In this case, the answer during early interviews is "I have not done much research about the company. The position sounds quite appealling so I prefer spend my time on the initial phone screens to ensure a mutual fit and interest. I will read up on the company in preparation for my final interview or interviews."

# Wait

Now, cross your fingers and hope your effort pays off with response. If so, great! If not, on to the next company : )
